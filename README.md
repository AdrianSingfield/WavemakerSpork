# Wavemaker Spork - A Fork of Wavemaker Cards V3

### Ok, but why?

This is a personal project to customize Wavemaker for my own needs.

I have been writing in Wavemaker V3 for many years. However, I don't need most of the tools it offers and a couple things I wanted were missing.
So here I am sticking my fingers into the gears and making my own thing to run locally :)

Go to  https://wavemakercards.github.io for the official version or https://github.com/wavemakercards/wavemakercards.github.io for the code.
